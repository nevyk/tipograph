# Scripts

There are few helper scripts.

* Prepare release - run some checks, then execute building pipeline and prepare everything for commit and publish
* Readme - include documentation from modules into readme and apply *tipograph* on the whole content
* Rules - take presets' tests and make table of rules from them
