# tipograph

*A little javascript library and command line tool that makes your written content more typographically correct.*

> "When you ig­nore ty­pog­ra­phy, you’re ig­nor­ing an op­por­tu­nity to im­prove the ef­fec­tive­ness of your writing." -

Even if typography can be seen as a set of rules given by some freaks, it's actually quite an important aspect of
written content. Besides it brings an aesthetic value, it also helps a person to read the text more fluently and
comfortably. And curly quotes just look great!

However, to be typographically correct one has to make some non-trivial effort, be it to learn the rules or to find out
how to type all those special characters instead of these present on his keyboard. And therefore *tipograph* comes here
to help. It tries its best to fix a text and apply the rules.

It's impossible to manage all rules out there, because *tipograph* is just a set of simple transformation rules and it
doesn't understand wider linguistic context. And sometimes it will fail. But still, the help deserves to be appreciated.
Especially when it costs nothing.

*In version 0.4.0 there are API breaking changes as it's a complete rewrite. However, the migration should not be
difficult. [Here](https://github.com/pnevyk/tipograph/tree/v0.3.5) is the documentation for the old API.*

*Tipograph is not in stable phase yet. Rules will be added and improved over time. Feel free to make suggestion or ask
question if you have any.*

## Installation

**In node**

```shell
# to use it as library
npm install --save tipograph

# to use it as command line utility
npm install --global tipograph
```

**In brower**

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dest/tipograph.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
// in browser, tipograph is accessible as property of window
var tipograph = require('tipograph');

// initialize new instance
var typo1 = tipograph();

// initialize new instance with different configuration
var typo2 = tipograph({
    format: 'html',
    language: 'czech',
    presets: ['quotes', 'language']
});

typo2('"Hello <b>world</b>!"') // „Hello <b>world</b>!“

// stream support (only in node)
var fs = require('fs');

fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
    .pipe(tipograph.createStream(/*{ options }*/))
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
```

### CLI

*Tipograph* provides also command line interface. You just need to install it globally.

**Basic usage**

```shell
tipograph -i input.txt -o output.txt
```

**Help**

```shell
tipograph --help
```

*Note that writing the transformed content into the source file itself results in an empty file. Moreover, you should
always check the output if it's correct and make a backup of a source content if you want to write into it back.*


## Presets

There is a number of predefined rules which are grouped into presets. By default, all these presets are used, although
you can pick just those you want by passing an array into *options* object. If you want to apply your own custom rules,
you can pass your preset into the array (see [preset documentation](src/presets/readme.md) for more details). Note that
the order in *presets* array determines the order of rules application onto the input.

*Rules mentioned here don't cover all typography rules, just those which are handled by tipograph. Please, read some
other resources in order to be able to make your content better.*

*Description here is quite a general overview. You can see a lot of examples how these presets behave [here](rules.md).*

## Formats

The input might be in a different format than just a plain text and it might be important to take it into account. For
example, you don't want to apply typography rules inside HTML tag. For that case, you can specify the format
preprocessor. There are few already made, and again, you can define your own (see
[format documentation](src/formats/readme.md) for more details).

## Languages

Different languages may have different rules. The most notable example are quotes. There are few predefined languages
and you can define your own (see [language documentation](src/languages/readme.md) for more details). The language
contains configuration for some presets (at the moment, only *quotes*) and moreover it contains rules specific for the
language. Just don't forget to include *language* preset into *presets* option.
