# tipograph

*A little javascript library and command line tool that makes your written content more typographically correct.*

**STATUS:** The library is in passive maintenance. I don't have any active use
of this project personally. Nevertheless, all feature requests and bug reports
will be addressed in a reasonable time manner.

Even if typography can be seen as a set of rules given by some freaks, it's actually quite an important aspect of
written content. Besides it brings an aesthetic value, it also helps a person to read the text more fluently and
comfortably. And curly quotes just look great!

However, to be typographically correct one has to make some non-trivial effort, be it to learn the rules or to find out
how to type all those special characters instead of these present on his keyboard. And therefore *tipograph* comes here
to help. It tries its best to fix a text and apply the rules.

It's impossible to manage all rules out there, because *tipograph* is just a set of simple transformation rules and it
doesn't understand wider linguistic context. And sometimes it will fail. But still, the help deserves to be appreciated.
Especially when it costs nothing.

*In version 0.4.0 there are API breaking changes as it's a complete rewrite. However, the migration should not be
difficult (see the [guide](03to04.md)). If you are interested, [here](https://github.com/pnevyk/tipograph/tree/v0.3.5)
is the documentation for the old API.*

*Tipograph is not in stable phase yet. Rules will be added and improved over time. Feel free to make suggestion or ask
question if you have any.*

Note that Tipograph is focused on character substitution text-wise.
Therefore it has a different goal than [Typeset](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Typeset) library
which focuses on nice typography regarding appearance
(although there is a small overlap in some pattern substitution).

## Demo

You can see what *tipograph* help you with [here](http://pnevyk.github.io/tipograph/).

## Installation

**In node**

```shell
# to use it as library
npm install --save tipograph

# to use it as command line utility
npm install --global tipograph
```

**In browser**

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/tipograph"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
// in browser, tipograph is accessible as property of window
var tipograph = require('tipograph');

// initialize new instance
var typo1 = tipograph();

// initialize new instance with different configuration
var typo2 = tipograph({
    format: 'html',
    language: 'czech',
    presets: ['quotes', 'language'],
    post: 'latex',
    options: {
        dash: 'em',
    },
});

typo2('"Ahoj <b style="color: red;">světe</b>!"') // „Ahoj <b style="color: red;">světe</b>!“

// stream support (only in node)
var fs = require('fs');

fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
    .pipe(tipograph.createStream(/*{ options }*/))
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
```

### CLI

*Tipograph* also provides command line interface. You just need to install the package globally.

**Basic usage**

```shell
tipograph -i input.txt -o output.txt
```

**Help**

```shell
tipograph --help
```

*Note that writing the transformed content into the source file itself results in an empty file. Moreover, you should
always check the output whether it's correct and make a backup of a content if you want to write into the file back.*


## Presets

There is a number of predefined rules which are grouped into presets. By default, all these presets are used, although
you can pick just those you want by passing an array into *options* object. If you want to apply your own custom rules,
you can pass your preset into the array (see [preset documentation](src/presets/readme.md) for more details). Note that
the order in *presets* array determines the order of rules application onto the input.

*Rules mentioned here don't cover all typography rules, just those which are handled by tipograph. Please, read some
other resources in order to be able to make your content better.*

*Description here is quite a general overview. You can see a lot of examples how these presets behave [here](rules.md).*

<!-- {{ presets }} -->

#### custom

If *tipograph*'s rules are not enough for you, you can define your own. Please, consider whether your rule would make
sense in *tipograph* core, and if so, I will gladly accept your contribution.

```js
var custom = function (language) {
    // set of rules
    return [
        // rule is a pair of search value and its replacement
        [/-([a-z])/g, function (match, letter) {
            return letter.toUpperCase();
        }]
    ];
};

var typo1 = tipograph({ presets: [custom] });                   // use only your custom preset
var typo2 = tipograph({ presets: tipograph.extend([custom]) }); // or extend the default presets
```

## Formats

The input might be in a different format than just a plain text and it might be important to take it into account. For
example, you don't want to apply typography rules inside HTML tag. For that case, you can specify the format
preprocessor. There are few already made, and again, you can define your own (see
[format documentation](src/formats/readme.md) for more details).

<!-- {{ formats }} -->

## Postprocessing

Sometimes the special characters need to be replaced with their corresponding macros/entities in an output format, so
that the file can be saved as ascii-encoded file or the compiler/interpreter of the format (and the human too)
understands it.

<!-- {{ post }} -->

## Changes

It is possible to retrieve the information how the text was changed by tipograph. This can be useful for providing the
user with these details or to implement more complex application above tipograph (e.g., WYSIWYG editor). This
information is in the form of the collection of pairs where the first item of the pair represents an index slice in the
source text and the second items an index slice in the output text. Probably more understandable from an example:

```js
var typo = tipograph();

typo('"lorem --- ipsum"', function (converted, changes) {
    // process the changes:
    // [
    //     [[0, 1], [0, 1]], // '"' -> '\u201C'
    //     [[6, 11], [6, 9]], // '"' -> '\u200a\u2014\u200a'
    //     [[16, 17], [14, 15]] // '"' -> '\u201D'
    // ]

    // converted: '\u201Clorem\u200a\u2014\u200aipsum\u201D'
    // return the converted text
    // this return value becomes the return value of the whole `typo` function
    // you can also return the changes
    return converted;
});

// stream
fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
    .pipe(tipograph.createStream(/*{ options }, */callback))
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
```

## Languages

Different languages may have different rules. The most notable example are quotes. There are few predefined languages
and you can define your own (see [language documentation](src/languages/readme.md) for more details). The language
contains configuration for some presets (at the moment, only *quotes*) and moreover it contains rules specific for the
language. Just don't forget to include *language* preset into *presets* option.

<!-- {{ languages }} -->

#### custom

If you need a language which is not included in *tipograph* core or you need to make specific changes to a built-in
language, you can do so by passing the language object instead of a name. The same as in custom preset case, consider
contributing your language to *tipograph* itself.

```js
var typo = tipograph({
    language: {
        quotes: [
            // french quotes (see src/quotes.js)
            [tipograph.quotes.DOUBLE_LEFT_SPACE, tipograph.quotes.DOUBLE_RIGHT_SPACE],
            [tipograph.quotes.SINGLE_LEFT_SPACE, tipograph.quotes.SINGLE_RIGHT_SPACE]
        ],
        // same interface as in custom preset
        rules: []
    }
});
```

If you want to reuse either quotes or rules definition of an existing language, it is possible using exported
`languages` property, that is, using `tipograph.languages.french.quotes` and `tipograph.languages.french.rules`.
